# Items
iOS app that tracks all kind of essentials that you wish to buy.

## About
Items is my first long-term project built to help me collect all of my wishlists in one place.
I started to develop this application with intention to submit it to AppStore, but after months of developing decided to not do that due to potential Database costs.
Since then this application is used as a part of my Portfolio as a iOS Developer.

Current version of Items is available to test via [TestFlight Beta](https://testflight.apple.com/join/jOUyhD7f)

## Frameworks, libraries and products used
* SwiftUI as a main UI tool
* Firebase as Database
* UIKit to help integrate libraries such as UIImagePickerController
